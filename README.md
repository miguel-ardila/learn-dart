# Dart Course at Devtalles

Welcome to the Dart course at Devtalles, a comprehensive tutorial to learn Dart from scratch to an advanced level.

## Description

This course is designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts of Dart, a modern programming language developed by Google, used to create high-performance applications for web, servers, and mobile.

## Project Structure

- `bin/`: Contains the program's entry file. This is where your application's execution starts.
